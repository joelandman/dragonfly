</head>
<body>
Dragonfly is available under a either a GPLv2-only license, or a commerial license.
The following text is a clarification about which options are appropriate for
your case.
    
<h2>DragonFly Commercial License</h2>

<p align="justify">

The Commercial License is an agreement with Scalable Informatics for
organizations that do not want to release their application source code or
require support.  Commercially licensed customers get a commercially supported product
from Scalable Informatics. Commercially licensed users are also free from the
requirement of making their own application open source.
<br />
<br />
When your application is not licensed under either the GPLv2-only Free
Software License as defined by the Free Software Foundation or approved by OSI,
and you intend to or you may distribute DragonFly software, you must first
obtain a commercial license to the DragonFly product.
<br />
<br />
<h3>Typical examples of DragonFly distribution include:</h3>
<br />
<ul>
 <li>  Selling software that includes DragonFly to customers who install the software on their own machines.</li>
 <li>  Selling software that requires users and/or customers to install DragonFly themselves on their own machines.</li>
 <li>  Building a hardware system that includes DragonFly and selling that hardware system to customers for installation at their own locations.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
<h3>Specifically:</h3>
<br />
<ul>
 <li> If you include the DragonFly server with an application that is not licensed
      under the GPL or GPL-compatible license, you need a commercial license for
      the DragonFly server.</li>
 <li> If you develop and distribute a commercial application and as part of utilizing
      your application, the end-user must download a copy of DragonFly; for each
      derivative work, you (or, in some cases, your end-user) need a commercial
      license for the DragonFly server and/or DragonFly client libraries.</li>
 <li> If you include one or more of the DragonFly programs in your non-GPL application
      (so that your application can run with DragonFly), you need a commercial license
      for the program(s) in question. 
 <li> GPL users have no direct legal relationship with Scalable Informatics LLC.
      The commercial license, on the other hand, is Scalable Informatics LLC private
      license, and provides a direct legal relationship with Scalable Informatics LLC.  It
      is possible for GPL users to make a seperate legal consulting or featured development
      agreement with Scalable Informatics LLC.  This agreement shall be independent of
      the commercial license, and cannot be used to abrogate the terms and conditions of
      the license.
</ul>
 
<br />
<br />
With a commercial non-GPL DragonFly server license, one license is required per
HPC system head node or application server used by end users to interact with DragonFly.
There are no restrictions on the number of connections, number of users, number of
compute nodes, number of CPUs, memory or disks to that one DragonFly server.
<br />
<br />

<h3>Non-Profits, Academic Institutions, and Private Individuals</h3>

If you represent a non-profit organization or an academic institution, we recommend
you publish your application as an open source / free software project using the
GPLv2-only license. In this manner, you are free to use DragonFly software free
of charge under the GPL license. We believe that if you have strong reasons to
not publish your application in accordance with the GPLv2-only, you should
purchase commercial licenses. 
<br />
<br />


If you are a private individual you are free to use DragonFly software for your
personal applications as long as you do not distribute them. If you distribute
them, you must make a decision between the Commercial License and the GPLv2-only.
<br />
<br />

Please note that even if you ship a free demo version of your own application,
the above rules apply.
<br />
<br />

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

Please note that Scalable Informatics LLC can only give advice on which license
is right for you. The final judgment, of course can be made only by a court of
law. With that said, we recommend the commercial license to all commercial and
government organizations. This frees you from the broad and strict requirements
of the GPLv2-only license.

To all free software enthusiasts we recommend our products under the GPLv2-only
license.

To anyone in doubt, we recommend the commercial license. It is never wrong.

<h2>Obligations</h2>
Licensee is bound by the license by the act of installing the software, or allowing

or after installation, and one or more of the commercial license requirements are
met, it is the obligation of the end user to obtain an appropriate commercial license
from <a href="http://scalableinformatics.com">Scalable Informatics LLC</a>
